# Mental Health Student Filtering Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented filtering functionality for MentalHealthPage to show only assessments for the specific student when opened from StudentDetail page.

## Changes Made

### 1. MentalHealthPage.tsx
- **Added interface**: `MentalHealthPageProps` with optional `studentId` prop
- **Updated function signature**: `MentalHealthPage({ studentId }: MentalHealthPageProps = {})`
- **Enhanced filtering logic**: Now uses provided `studentId` prop when available
- **Improved filtering priority**:
  1. If `studentId` prop is provided → use it (for student detail view)
  2. If student role → show only their own data (`user?.userId`)
  3. If admin/counselor role → show all data (`undefined`)

### 2. StudentDetail.tsx
- **Updated MentalHealthPage call**: Now passes `studentId={student.studentId || student.id}` prop
- **Consistent with other components**: Now follows same pattern as SessionsPage, BehaviorPage, and CareerPage

## Filtering Logic Flow

```typescript
const studentIdFilter = studentId 
  ? studentId // Use specific student ID from props (Student Detail view)
  : (isAdmin || isCounselor) ? undefined : user?.userId; // Role-based filtering
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Student Detail Page (NEW BEHAVIOR)
- **Context**: Admin/Counselor navigates to `/app/students/{studentId}` → Mental Health tab
- **Expected**: Shows only assessments for that specific student
- **Previously**: Would show all assessments or current user's assessments
- **Now**: ✅ Shows filtered assessments for the selected student

### 2. General Mental Health Page (UNCHANGED BEHAVIOR)
- **Context**: Navigate directly to `/app/mental-health`
- **Student role**: Shows only their own assessments
- **Admin/Counselor role**: Shows all assessments
- **Behavior**: ✅ Unchanged and working correctly

### 3. Role-based Access (UNCHANGED BEHAVIOR)
- **Student role**: Can only see their own data
- **Counselor role**: Can see all student data in table format
- **Admin role**: Can see all data with admin dashboard
- **Behavior**: ✅ Unchanged and working correctly

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UX**: Now all tabs in StudentDetail (Sessions, Mental Health, Behavior, Career) show data for the selected student
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality remains unchanged when accessing Mental Health page directly
3. **Proper Data Isolation**: Maintains security by showing only relevant data based on context
4. **Role Flexibility**: Supports both role-based filtering and student-specific filtering

## Verification

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to any student detail page: `/app/students/{studentId}`
2. Click on "Mental Health" tab
3. Verify that only assessments for that specific student are displayed
4. Test with different student IDs to confirm filtering works correctly
5. Verify that direct navigation to `/app/mental-health` still works as expected

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The Mental Health page now properly filters assessments based on the selected student when accessed from the Student Detail page, while maintaining all existing role-based filtering functionality.
