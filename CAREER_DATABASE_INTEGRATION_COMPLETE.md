## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🗄️ **Backend API Implementation**
- ✅ **Career Resources CRUD** - Complete implementation in `backend/app.py`
  - GET `/api/career-resources` (with filtering by type and tags)
  - POST `/api/career-resources` (create new resource)
  - GET `/api/career-resources/{id}` (get single resource)
  - PUT `/api/career-resources/{id}` (update resource)
  - DELETE `/api/career-resources/{id}` (soft delete)

- ✅ **Career Assessments CRUD** - Complete implementation in `backend/app.py`
  - GET `/api/career-assessments` (with student filtering)
  - POST `/api/career-assessments` (create new assessment)
  - GET `/api/career-assessments/{id}` (get single assessment)
  - PUT `/api/career-assessments/{id}` (update assessment)
  - DELETE `/api/career-assessments/{id}` (soft delete)

### 🔗 **Frontend API Integration**
- ✅ **Updated careerService.ts** to use real database endpoints
- ✅ **Disabled mock data usage** (`useMockData = false`)
- ✅ **Fixed endpoint URLs** to match backend implementation
- ✅ **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing frontend components

### 💾 **Database Integration**
- ✅ **Connected to MySQL database** (`counselorhub`)
- ✅ **Using existing career_resources table**
- ✅ **Using existing career_assessments table**
- ✅ **Proper foreign key relationships** with students table
- ✅ **Data persistence verified** across multiple requests
