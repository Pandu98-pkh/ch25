# Mental Health Page Data Filtering Test Report

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed AssessmentContext Role-Based Filtering**
   - Modified `AssessmentProvider` in `src/contexts/AssessmentContext.tsx`
   - Students now see only their own data (`studentId` filter applied)
   - Counselors and Admins see all data (`studentId` filter set to `undefined`)

2. **Fixed Counselor View**
   - Replaced sample data in counselor table with real assessment data
   - Added proper empty state handling
   - Fixed table structure and data display

3. **Enhanced Test Data**
   - Added 6 sample mental health assessments across 3 different students
   - Each student has 2 assessments for better testing
   - Mixed risk levels (low, moderate, high) and assessment types (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DASS-21)

4. **Added Role Testing Panel**
   - Created `RoleTestPanel.tsx` for easy role switching during development
   - Added buttons to switch between different student roles and admin/counselor roles
   - Only visible in development environment

## Test Scenarios

### Student Role Testing
- **Student 1 (test-student-1)**: Should see 2 assessments (DASS-21 low risk, PHQ-9 moderate risk)
- **Student 2 (test-student-2)**: Should see 2 assessments (DASS-21 moderate risk, GAD-7 high risk)  
- **Student 3 (test-student-3)**: Should see 2 assessments (PHQ-9 low risk, DASS-21 high risk)

### Counselor Role Testing
- Should see all 6 assessments from all students
- Table format with student identification
- Ability to view and delete assessments

### Admin Role Testing  
- Should see all 6 assessments from all students
- Comprehensive dashboard with statistics
- Assessment overview cards showing totals by type
- High-risk student count

## Expected Behavior

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Students only see their own mental health assessments
- ✅ Students cannot see other students' data
- ✅ Counselors can see all student data for monitoring
- ✅ Admins can see all data for administration

### UI Differences by Role
- **Student View**: Personal dashboard with individual assessment cards and progress tracking
- **Counselor View**: Table format showing all students' assessments for monitoring
- **Admin View**: Administrative dashboard with statistics and oversight capabilities

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to Mental Health page**: `/mental-health`
3. **Use the Role Test Panel** (bottom right corner in development):
   - Click "Student 1" - should see 2 assessments only
   - Click "Student 2" - should see 2 different assessments only  
   - Click "Student 3" - should see 2 different assessments only
   - Click "Counselor" - should see all 6 assessments in table format
   - Click "Admin" - should see all 6 assessments with admin dashboard

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. `UserContext` provides role information (`isAdmin`, `isCounselor`)
2. `AssessmentContext` uses role to determine filtering:
   ```typescript
   const studentIdFilter = (isAdmin || isCounselor) ? undefined : user?.id || 'anonymous';
   ```
3. `useMentalHealthAssessments` hook applies filter to API calls
4. `MentalHealthPage` renders different views based on role

### Security Considerations
- Data filtering happens at the context level, ensuring consistent behavior
- API calls respect the `studentId` parameter for proper data isolation
- Role-based UI rendering prevents unauthorized access to sensitive views

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The mental health page now properly filters data based on user roles:
- Students see only their own assessment data
- Counselors and admins see all data in appropriate table formats
- Role-based UI rendering provides appropriate interfaces for each user type
